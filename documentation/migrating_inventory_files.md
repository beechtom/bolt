You can view upgrade instructions for your operating system at [Installing
Bolt](bolt_installing.md).

## Migrating inventory files from version 1 to version 2

To maintain compatibility with Bolt, migrate your Version 1 inventory files to
Version 2. You can complete this process manually by changing the names of some
of the keys in the inventory file, or automatically using a Bolt command.

### Automatic migration

To automatically migrate a Version 1 inventory file to Version 2, use the
following command:

- _\*nix shell command_

  ```shell
  bolt project migrate
  ```

- _PowerShell cmdlet_

  ```powershell
  Update-BoltProject
  ```

Bolt will locate the inventory file for the current Bolt project and migrate it
in place. You can specify the projects and inventory files you want to migrate
using the `--project` and `--inventoryfile` command-line options.

> **Note:** This command modifies an inventory file in place and does not
> preserve comments or formatting. Before using the command, make sure to backup
> the inventory file.

### Manual migration

To manually migrate a Version 1 inventory file, begin by changing all instances
of `nodes` keys to `targets` keys.

`nodes` => `targets`

Then, change any instance of a `name` key in a `Target` object to a `uri` key.

`name` => `uri`

#### Version 1 inventory file

```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    nodes:
      - name: target1.example.com
        alias: target1
      - name: target2.example.com
        alias: target2
```

#### Version 2 inventory file

```yaml
groups:
  - name: linux
    targets:
      - uri: target1.example.com
        alias: target1
      - uri: target2.example.com
        alias: target2
```
